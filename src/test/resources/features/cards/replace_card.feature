Feature: Replace Card

  Rule: Customers can replace a card if they haven't replaced a card
    previously within the last 24 hours, and they have not surpassed
      the limited number of card replacements. If the card is a physical
        card then the customers also need to have enough funds if they
          have used all free replacements.
