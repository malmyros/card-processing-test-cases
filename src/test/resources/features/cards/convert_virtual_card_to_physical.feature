Feature: Convert a Virtual Card to a Physical Card

  Rule: Customers can convert their virtual cards to physical for free
    if they have remaining replacements, and for a fee if they have enough
      funds. The card delivery address needs to be different from the customer's
        address, to allow the card to be deliver across the world. Depending on
          where the card is delivered there might be a different cost.
